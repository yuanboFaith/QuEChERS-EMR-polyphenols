### Method development and validation for analysis of phenolic compounds in fatty complex matrices using enhanced matrix removal (EMR) lipid cleanup and UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS
This work (see [original article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814621021026) published in *Food Chemistry*) developed a robust analytical method for 55 phenolic compounds in fatty matrices, utilizing QuEChERS and Enhanced Matrix Removal (EMR)-lipid cleanup in 96-well plates, along with UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS. Method validation across seven high-fat matrices yielded promising recoveries and accuracy, showing potential for high-throughput and sensitive analysis in diverse applications.
