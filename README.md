### Method development and validation for analysis of phenolic compounds in fatty complex matrices using enhanced matrix removal (EMR) lipid cleanup and UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS
This work (see [**original article**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814621021026) published in *Food Chemistry*) developed a robust analytical method for 55 phenolic compounds in fatty matrices, utilizing QuEChERS and Enhanced Matrix Removal (EMR)-lipid cleanup in 96-well plates, along with UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS. Method validation across seven high-fat matrices yielded promising recoveries and accuracy, showing potential for high-throughput and sensitive analysis in diverse applications. 
This file documents the original R code constructed for various analysis. The code and output can be accessed [here](https://yuanbofaith.github.io/QuEChERS-EMR-polyphenols/). 

The R code has been developed with reference to [**R for Data Science (2e)**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), and the official documentation of [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [**DataBrewer.co**](https://www.databrewer.co/). See breakdown of modules below:

- **Data visualization** with **ggplot2** ([**tutorial**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/visualization/introduction) of the fundamentals; and [**data viz. gallery**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/gallery)).

- [**Data wrangling**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling) with the following packages:
[**tidyr**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tidyr/introduction): transform (e.g., pivoting) the dataset into tidy structure; [**dplyr**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/dplyr/0-introduction): the basic tools to work with data frames; [**stringr**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/stringr/0-introduction): work with strings; [**regular expression**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/regular-expression/0-introduction): search and match a string pattern; [**purrr**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/purrr/introduction): functional programming (e.g., iterating functions across elements of columns); and [**tibble**](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tibble/introduction): work with data frames in the modern tibble structure.
